Question 1: Allesina 1.11.2
	1. How many times were the levels of individuals 3 and 27 recorded?
		3: 61 times
		27: 5 times

	2. Write a script taking as input the file name and the ID of the individual, and returning the number of records for that ID.
		cut -f 1 $filename | grep -c -w "$ID"

	3. Write a script that returns the number of times each individual was sampled.
		This seems like the same question as number 2

Question 2: Allesina 1.11.3
	1. for number of columns: head -n 1 n10.txt | tr ' ' '\n' | head -n -1 | wc -l
	   for number of rows: wc -l n10.txt
	   #Can't figure out how to put both into a script
	2 and 3. No hope if I can't figure out 1.
